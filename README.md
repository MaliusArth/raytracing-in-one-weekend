# Ray Tracing In One Weekend

I'm learning about ray tracing by following along the [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book.

In doing so I take the liberty to diverge from the book's author's decisions, letting myself step into pitfalls and making my own structural and implementational choices for the benefit of a greater understanding of the matter.

My programming language of choice is [odin](https://odin-lang.org)
